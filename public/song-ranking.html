<h1>My Favorite Songs</h1>

<h2>My top 3 songs of all-time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Mirror Ball by Taylor Swift</h3>
<p>From my perspective, this is a song about how the writer tried so hard to please people or seek validation from others to feel that she is good enough.
I feel like I can relate to this song so much. I have very low-selfesteem and I never feel good enough about myself. And, I would priortize other's feeling instead of mine. I would try my best to impress people and get attention or recognition from them.
This song is such a tharapy. I'm now trying my best to pleasing others that much and love myself unconditionally.

<h3>Show Yourself</h3>
<p>I can relate Elsa's feelings and it turned out that we have the same MBTI. As like the lyrics, I am ready to learn all the new thing and experience them and grow into the better version of myself.
I don't need to rely on other people and the real good friend is it's just me.</p>

<h3>Into the unknown</h3>
<p>This is also Frozen's song track and I love the lyrics. So meaningful.</p>
